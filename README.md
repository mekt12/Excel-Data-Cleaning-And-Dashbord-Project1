Healthcare insurance charge – Excel dashboard
 
Objective
In this project, I will clean a healthcare insurance charge dataset in excel and use pivot tables to analyze the features that most affect insurance charges to individuals. Based on the analysis from the pivot tables, we will use charts and slicers to visualize the findings of the analysis.
Tools used
Pivot tables, charts and slicers are used for analysis and visualization.
Key findings and insights
I found that smokers paid significantly higher for health insurance than non-smokers. Age brackets also affected insurance charges, older individuals (46-64 age bracket) paid higher insurance. BMI also affected insurance charges, obese individuals paid more. Number of children and region of individuals also attributed for some variations in insurance charges.
